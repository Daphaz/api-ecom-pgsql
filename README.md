## How to use it
>To use the api locally you will need an instance of postgres and to configure an .env file at the root of the project with the different variables below:

**Environment variables in an .env file**

````bash
POSTGRES_DB= #the name of your database
POSTGRES_USER= #the posgresql username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD= #the password of your posgresql user
POSTGRES_HOST=# the hostname of your postgresql
POSTGRES_PORT= #the port of your postgresql

FRONTEND_URL= #the front-end address for the cors origin
JWT_PAYLOAD= #the secret key for your jwt token

PORT= #the port for your node server
````

**launching nodejs**
>Once your database is accessible and configured you can:

````bash
# npm version: 6.14.12, node version: 14.16.1
# install the packages
npm install

# launch the server in development mode
npm run dev
````

## Documentation
>I wanted to discover and use [swagger](https://swagger.io/) to generate a documentation of the api for that I used 2 packages [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) and [swagger-jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc)

### The route I have chosen is **/api-docs**
